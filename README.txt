This is a rudimentary (temporary) command line interface tool kit for White - Storm: Lightning (alpha) release 2, 
although it may work with other releases.

It is a bit unforgiving, so please make sure you input the file directory correctly when it starts up!
If you do not, things will break! The "correct file directory" would be the directory WSL.exe resides in.

As of the current moment, the tool kit only edits and creates entity files, not level files, and not
Lua script files.

Be warned you need to input src/Scripts/Objects/SOME_ENTITY_NAME_/SOME_SCRIPT.lua when you are editing
a script attribute, or at least src/SOME_ENTITY_NAME_/SOME_SCRIPT.lua, however the first option is the convention.

Small Note: 
You may enter the following when editing a attribute for an entity: true, false, a number greater than zero,
the name of a file ending in .lua, the name of the entity, make sure you are inputting the correct things
to the correct attributes for the tool kit is very unforgiving and will crash!

Also returning to the main menu saves your work, nothing else does.

Have fun working with White - Storm: Lightning (alpha)!
